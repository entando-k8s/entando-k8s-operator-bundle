                    This property is required to provide the appropriate environment variables to the deployed container.
                    This should be used in conjunction with the 'EntandoApp.spec.customServerImage' property to indicate
                    which base image the custom server image was based on. If no customer server image is specified, this
                    property will result in the deployment of the entando/entando-de-app-eap image for the value 'eap',
                    the entando/entando-de-app-wildfly image for the value 'wildfly' and the entando/entando-de-app-tomcat

                    Use this property in conjunction with 'EntandoApp.spec.standardServerImage' to ensure that the
