                    The database management system (DBMS) to use for persistence of this EntandoApp. 
                    Can be any of mysql, oracle  postgresql, embedded or none. When 'embedded' is used, an in-process 
                    Derby database will be used and in the folder /entando-data which is where the standard
                    Entando persistent volume is mounted. Since the supporting database files can only be opened by one process at a time,
                    only 1 replica can be supported when the value is 'embedded'. 
                    If an EntandoDatabaseService has been
                    deployed in this EntandoApp's namespace, and the DBMS specified on this EntandoDatabaseService
                    is the same as the DBMS specified on this EntandoApp, the Entando Operator will create dedicated
                    schema s(in the case of PostgreSQL or Oracle), or databases in the case of MySQL for this EntandoApp
                    to persist its data. If a matching EntandoDatabaseService does not exist in this namespace, the Entando Operator
                    will automatically deploy the appropriate container to host the DBMS specified. This last option is not
                    yet supported for Oracle.
                    Three schemas/database will be created: the Entando Port DB, tne Entando Serv DB and a database for
                    the Entando Component Manager. If the Port and Serv schemas/databases are empty, the Entando Operator
                    will use the underlying Entando App to populate these datbases with the data backup available in the
                    standard backup path in the WAR deployment.
                    In scenarios where the EntandoApp needs to connect to an existing database that is fully managed 
                    by the customer, it is best to setup the standard database connection variables using the 
                    'spec.environmentVariables' property and set this property to 'none'. This will skip any database
                    preparations steps in the deployment.

                    information on how the hostname is determined. If absent, the Entando Operator will evaluate the
                    value of the ENTANDO_PATH_TO_TLS_KEYPAIR which is expected to contain two files: tls.key and tls.crt.
                    If a keypair is found in the folder specified, it will revert to the keypair found. Alternatively,
                    the Entando Operator will evaluate the value of the ENTANDO_USE_AUTO_CERT_GENERATION. If set to 'true'
                    the Entando Operator will assume that the cluster has been configured with a valid CA and leave it to

                        EntandoApp.  If no Namespace is provided,
                        but a name was provided, the Entando Operator will then look for the
                        EntandoClusterInfrastructure with the name specified in the same Namespace as this
                        EntandoApp and use it.

                  description: >
                    Specifies the standard server base image that this EntandoApp has been packaged in. Valid values
                    are wildfly (https://github.com/entando/entando-docker-base-images/tree/master/entando-wildfly17-base)
                    or eap (https://github.com/entando/entando-docker-base-images/tree/master/entando-eap72-clustered-base).
                    This property is required to provide the appropriate environment variables to the deployed container.
                    This should be used in conjunction with the 'EntandoApp.spec.customServerImage' property to indicate
                    which base image the custom server image was based on. If no customer server image is specified, this
                    property will result in the deployment of the entando/entando-de-app-eap image for the value 'eap',
                    and the entando/entando-de-app-wildfly image for the value 'wildfly'.

                  description: >
                    The full Docker image URI for the Docker image to be deployed. This is only required in scenarios
                    where the customer has created an independent Maven project based on the entando-de-app project
                    (https://github.com/entando-k8s/entando-de-app) and packaged this project to its own image.
                    Use this property in conjunction with 'EntandoApp.spec.standardServerImage' to ensure that the
                    Entando Operator provides it with the correct environment variables.
